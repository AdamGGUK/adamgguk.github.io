Now, I know what you're thinking: "What an incrediby unoriginal title!". 
And you're completely right. But there's a saying among programmers:<br>
<br>
"No need to reinvent the wheel."
<br><br>
So behind this timeless saying, I present my very first blog post.<br><br>
<h1 style="font-size:300%;"> Who am I? </h1>
If you've stumbled upon this blog, or simply haven't bothered to read the name printed no less than 4 times on the front page, I guess short introductions are in order.<br>
My name is Adam Grann, and I am a Danish programmer based in Dundee, Scotland.<br>
I'm currently enrolled at Abertay University, where I'm studying Computer Game Applications Development (CGAD), which I'm looking to finish with a 2:1 GPA this summer.
<br><br>
<h1 style="font-size:250%;"> What kind of programmer are you? </h1>
I consider myself to be a generalist. That means I can do (or learn to do) pretty much anything regarding programming.<br>
I like to think of myself as a "life-long" scholar, and am of the belief that one can never know enough about anything.<br><br>
That being said, I have a special fondness for 2D games in all shapes and sizes.<br>
I believe there's an innate craftsmanship to these games that (mostly) can't be replicated by 3D games (generalizing I know).<br>
Don't get me wrong though; I still love 3D games - I just prefer 2D.<br><br>
I love collaborating in teams, as there is a massive amount of knowledge one can glean from working with others.<br>
I'm also fond of working on my own, as that lets me live out my ideas and test new methods.

<h1 style="font-size:300%;"> Why Scotland? </h1>
Time for a bit of a rant! <br>
Scotland is a great country of innovators and trendsetters. They've long realized that video games are here to stay;
that's why they have great traditions, industry and education when it comes to games.<br><br>
Denmark, on the other hand, is way behind.<br><br>
Until recently, there were only a handful of video game-centric educations, and none of them had very good reputations.
There's also been next to no support from the government, who have been trying their best to pretend like the industry doesn't exist,
even though it's the single largest form of media in the world.<br><br>
As there were no options suitable for me in Denmark, I decided to relocate to Scotland to realize my dream of becoming a game programmer.
<br><br>
And that concludes my very first blog post!
<br>
In the future, I'll be looking to share tips, tricks and observations from my journey as a programmer.<br><br>
So stay tuned!
