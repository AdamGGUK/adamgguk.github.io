I am a video game programmer from Denmark, currently based in Dundee, Scotland. <br>
As a lifelong video game enjoyer, I've always wanted to learn all aspects of games development, from ideation and pre-production, to building and maintaining software.<br>
I have a special fondness for 2d Games, though I consider myself to be somewhat of a generalist.
